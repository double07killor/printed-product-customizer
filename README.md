## Google Sheets Sync

1. Navigate to **WooCommerce â†’ Filament Inventory** in the WordPress admin.
2. Enter your Google API key and full Google Sheet URL (e.g. `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/XYZ/edit#gid=123`) and save settings. The plugin will automatically extract the sheet and tab information.
3. Click **Sync Now** to fetch filament data.
4. The sheet must have a header row with columns: `slug`, `brand`, `material`, `price_per_kg`, `stock_grams`, `color`, `Color`, `texture`, `transparency`.
